OMAR - OSMORA Archive Format
------------------------------

OMAR is a minimal, bullshit free archive format aimed to replace
the old and outdated CPIO (copy in/out) format.

OMAR is designed for readonly in-memory filesystems (such as initramfs),
with simplicity, clarity and "getting it done" in mind.
